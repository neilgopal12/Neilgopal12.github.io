<!--Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.
make sure all the content on your page is mobile-responsive using a bootstrap container Fluid divider element.
we'll create a Bootstrap row for our inline elements.
Now that we have a Bootstrap Row, let's split it into two columns to house our elements.
Bootstrap has a class called well that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns.
Now we're several div elements deep on each column of our row. This is as deep as we'll need to go. Now we can add our button elements.
Applying the Default Bootstrap Button Style: Bootstrap has another button class called btn-default.
Create a Class to Target with jQuery selectors: Not every class needs to have corresponding CSS. Sometimes we create classes just for the purpose of selecting these elements more easily using jQuery. 
Recall that in addition to class attributes, you can give each of your elements an id attribute.

Each id must be unique to a specific element and used only once per page.

Let's give a unique id to each of our div elements of class well.
For the sake of clarity, let's label both of our wells with their ids.
Just like we labeled our wells, we want to label our buttons.
When we start using jQuery, we will modify HTML elements without needing to actually change them in HTML.

Let's make sure that everyone knows they shouldn't actually modify any of this code directly.
Now we're ready to learn jQuery, the most popular JavaScript tool of all time. Don't worry about JavaScript itself - we will cover it soon.

Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add some things to our HTML.
Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a script element, including jQuery.
Now we have a document ready function.

Now let's write our first jQuery statement. All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.

jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element.

For example, let's make all of your button elements bounce. Just add this code inside your document ready function:

$("button").addClass("animated bounce");

Note that we've already included both the jQuery library and the Animate.css library in the background so that you can use them in the editor. So you are using jQuery to apply the Animate.css bounce class to your button elements.

Additionally make sure to use $("button").addClass("animated bounce"); instead of $('button').addClass("animated bounce"); since single-quote selectors will not pass our tests.
You see how we made all of your button elements bounce? We selected them with $("button"), then we added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");.

You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.

First, let's target your div elements with the class well by using the $(".well") selector.

Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a . before the class's name.

Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and shake.

For example, you could make all the elements with the class text-primary shake by adding the following to your document ready function:

$(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake");
You can also target elements by their id attributes.
Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a # before the id's name.
Delete jQuery functions: These animations were cool at first, but now they're getting kind of distracting.
Now you know three ways of targeting elements: by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn"), and by id $("#target1").

Although it is possible to add multiple classes in a single .addClass() call, let's add them to the same element in three separate ways.

In the same way you can add classes to an element with jQuery's addClass() function, you can remove them with jQuery's removeClass() function.

Here's how you would do this for a specific button:

$("#target2").removeClass("btn-default");
We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery.

jQuery has a function called .css() that allows you to change the CSS of an element.

Here's how we would change its color to blue:

$("#target1").css("color", "blue");

This is slightly different from a normal CSS declaration, because the CSS property and its value are in quotes, and separated with a comma instead of a colon.
You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons.

When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked.

jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.

Here's how you would disable all buttons:

$("button").prop("disabled", true);
Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. You can even change HTML markup.

jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.

Here's how you would rewrite and emphasize the text of our heading:

$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");

jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.
Now let's remove an HTML element from your page using jQuery.

jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely
Now let's try moving elements from one div to another.

jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.

For example, if we wanted to move target4 from our right well to our left well, we would use:

$("#target4").appendTo("#left-well");
In addition to moving elements, you can also copy them from one place to another.

jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.

For example, if we wanted to copy target2 from our left-well to our right-well, we would use:

$("#target2").clone().appendTo("#right-well");

Did you notice this involves sticking two jQuery functions together? This is called function chaining and it's a convenient way to get things done with jQuery.
Every HTML element has a parent element from which it inherits properties.

For example, your jQuery Playground h3 element has the parent element of <div class="container-fluid">, which itself has the parent body.

jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected.

Here's an example of how you would use the parent() function if you wanted to give the parent element of the left-well element a background color of blue:

$("#left-well").parent().css("background-color", "blue")
Many HTML elements have children which inherit their properties from their parent HTML elements.

For example, every HTML element is a child of your body element, and your "jQuery Playground" h3 element is a child of your <div class="container-fluid"> element.

jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.

Here's an example of how you would use the children() function to give the children of your left-well element the color of blue:

$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")
You've seen why id attributes are so convenient for targeting with jQuery selectors. But you won't always have such neat ids to work with.

Fortunately, jQuery has some other tricks for targeting the right elements.

jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(n) css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.

Here's how you would give the third element in each well the bounce class:

$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");

You can also target all the even-numbered elements.

Here's how you would target all the odd-numbered elements with class target and give them classes:

$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");

Note that jQuery is zero-indexed, meaning that, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element, fourth element, and so on.
We're done playing with our jQuery playground. Let's tear it down!

jQuery can target the body element as well.

Here's how we would make the entire body fade out: $("body").addClass("animated fadeOut");
